# Convert ODRL policies to authorisation rules

This service supports converting authorisation rules expressed as [ODRL](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/) policies to corresponding rules for the [sparql-parser](https://github.com/mu-semtech/sparql-parser) service.

This service is currently under development, this README will be extended along the way.
